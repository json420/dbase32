Reporting Bugs
==============

The `dbase32 Launchpad project`_ is where all Dbase32 development is
coordinated, including bug tracking.

If you're using `Ubuntu`_ and have the ``python3-dbase32`` package installed,
the best way to file a bug is to open a terminal and run::

    ubuntu-bug python3-dbase32

This will automatically attach useful information to the bug report, which
can greatly help in diagnosing the problem.

Otherwise, please file a bug directly `through the web UI`_.

Also see :doc:`install`.
